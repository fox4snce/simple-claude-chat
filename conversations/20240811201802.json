      "content": "Certainly! I'd be happy to show you the FizzBuzz program in Python. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's understand what FizzBuzz is:\n   - Print numbers from 1 to 100\n   - For multiples of 3, print \"Fizz\" instead of the number\n   - For multiples of 5, print \"Buzz\" instead of the number\n   - For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print \"FizzBuzz\"\n\n2. Now, let's write the Python code:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(1, 101):\n    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n    elif i % 3 == 0:\n        print(\"Fizz\")\n    elif i % 5 == 0:\n        print(\"Buzz\")\n    else:\n        print(i)\n```\n\n3. Let's break down the code:\n   - We use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 100.\n   - We check for multiples of both 3 and 5 first (using the modulo operator `%`).\n   - Then we check for multiples of 3.\n   - Then we check for multiples of 5.\n   - If none of these conditions are met, we simply print the number.\n\n4. The order of the conditions is important:\n   - We check for multiples of both 3 and 5 first because if we checked for multiples of 3 or 5 first, we'd miss the \"FizzBuzz\" case.\n\n5. To run this program, you can save it as a .py file (e.g., `fizzbuzz.py`) and run it using Python from your command line or in an IDE.\n\nThis implementation is concise and follows the rules of FizzBuzz exactly. It's a common coding interview question because it tests basic programming skills and attention to detail."
