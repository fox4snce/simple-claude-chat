First, let's create a more specific system message:\n\n```markdown\nYou are an expert at creating concise, relevant titles for conversations. Your task is to generate extremely short (1-5 words) but descriptive names based on the conversation content. Focus on the main topic or theme.\n```\n\n2. Now, let's improve the user prompt with examples:\n\n```markdown\nBased on the following conversation, suggest an extremely short (1-5 words) but descriptive name for it. The name should capture the essence of the conversation.\n\nExamples:\nConversation: \"How do I bake chocolate chip cookies from scratch?\"\nName: \"Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies\"\n\nConversation: \"What are the best places to visit in Paris for a first-time traveler?\"\nName: \"Paris Travel Tips\"\n\nConversation: \"Can you explain the basics of quantum computing?\"\nName: \"Quantum Computing Basics\"\n\nNow, here's the conversation to name:\n\n{full_message}\n\nSuggested name:\n```\n\n3. Adjust the parameters:\n\n```python\nmax_tokens=10  # Reduced from 20 to encourage shorter names\ntemperature=0.5  # Slightly reduced to get more focused results\n```\n\n4. Implement these changes in your code:\n\n```python\nif conversation['name'] == 'New Conversation':\n    name_prompt = f\"\"\"Based on the following conversation, suggest an extremely short (1-5 words) but descriptive name for it. The name should capture the essence of the conversation.\n\nExamples:\nConversation: \"How do I bake chocolate chip cookies from scratch?\"\nName: \"Baking Chocolate Chip Cookies\"\n\nConversation: \"What are the best places to visit in Paris for a first-time traveler?\"\nName: \"Paris Travel Tips\"\n\nConversation: \"Can you explain the basics of quantum computing?\"\nName: \"Quantum Computing Basics\"\n\nNow, here's the conversation to name:\n\n{full_message}\n\nSuggested name:\"\"\"\n\n    conversation_name = anth.generate_text_response(\n        system=\"You are an expert at creating concise, relevant titles for conversations. Your task is to generate extremely short (1-5 words) but descriptive names based on the conversation content. Focus on the main topic or theme.\",\n        user_message=name_prompt,\n        max_tokens=10,\n        temperature=0.5\n    ).strip()\n    conversation['name'] = conversation_name\n```\n\nThis improved prompt should help generate better, more concise conversation names by:\n\n1. Providing a more specific system message\n2. Giving clear examples of desired output\n3. Emphasizing the need for extremely short names\n4. Adjusting parameters to encourage brevity and focus"
